# Python API

Import supported operations and construction types from `hop_design`. Internal
module paths are not a compatibility guarantee.

## Compile and integrity

- `create_spec(sequence=..., design_id=...) -> HopSpec` expands the named,
  versioned generic default into explicit references.
- `load_spec(path) -> HopSpec | ResolvedHopSpec` safely loads strict JSON/YAML
  by exact schema ID under a byte limit and rejects symlinks.
- `check(spec) -> CheckReport` aggregates expected feasibility diagnostics and
  raises for corrupt configuration.
- `compile(spec)` compiles one explicit spec.
- `compile(sequence=..., design_id=...)` is the observationally equivalent
  convenience path.
- `Compilation.write(path)` verifies and atomically writes a new bundle path;
  it refuses to replace an existing path.
- `verify_bundle(path)` validates safe paths, complete inventory, digests, root
  identities, strict spec/plan/provenance schemas, cross-artifact references,
  plan-derived FASTA, absence of unmanifested files, and a complete deterministic
  replay of the spec into the stored plan, artifacts, and manifest.

Provide exactly one of `spec` or `sequence`. `design_id` is only valid with
`sequence`. Expected infeasibility raises `InfeasibleDesignError` at compile;
invalid call shapes raise `TypeError`; corrupt bundles raise
`BundleIntegrityError`.

## Payload records and variants

- `collect_payloads(records, duplicate_policy=...) -> PayloadCollection`
  consumes any iterable and records explicit `fail`, `dedupe`, or `keep`
  behavior for duplicate sequences. Duplicate record IDs always fail.
- `load_fasta_payloads(path) -> tuple[PayloadRecord, ...]` and
  `load_csv_payloads(path, id_column=..., sequence_column=...)` create the same
  strict records as inline input under explicit byte, record, and total-nt
  limits.
- `expand_payload(record, max_variants=...) -> PayloadExpansionResult` computes
  exact cardinality before allocation and raises `VariantBudgetExceededError`
  instead of truncating.
- `plan_design_space(space) -> DesignSpacePlan` computes Cartesian cardinality
  before row allocation, then returns one checked `ResolvedHopSpec` per bounded
  payload/foldback/basal/release combination without rendering bundles. Its
  explicit duplicate-final-sequence policy is `FAIL` or `KEEP`; it never drops
  combinations silently.

## Physical mechanics

- `evaluate_foldback(request) -> FoldbackEvaluation`
- `search_foldback_arms(request, limits=...) -> FoldbackSearchResult`
- `evaluate_basal_pairing(request, constraints=...) -> BasalEvaluation`
- `project_released_strand_state(request) -> ReleaseProjectionResult`
- `classify_motif_presence(sequence=..., motif=...) -> MotifPresenceReport`
- `scan_nicking_agent(sequence, agent=...) -> tuple[ResolvedNickSite, ...]`
- `scan_release_agent(sequence, agent=...) -> tuple[ResolvedReleaseSite, ...]`

Foldback, basal, and release operations accept explicit typed requests. Basal
pair classification is physical; active/reserve/reject classification comes
from the caller-supplied `BasalConstraintProfile`. See the
[mechanics reference](mechanics-api.md).

## Views

- `build_foldback_view(evaluation) -> WorkflowView`
- `build_released_workflow_view(state, foldback) -> WorkflowView`
- `build_basal_view(evaluation, nicked_strand=...) -> WorkflowView`
- `render_workflow_svg(view) -> bytes`

The renderer consumes the typed view and performs no molecular derivation.

Stable supporting types exported at package root include payload/spec models,
`Boundary`, `Span`, `Strand`, mechanics request/result models, processing agent
models, `WorkflowView`, and the documented error classes.
